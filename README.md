# TheTreePlantingSimulator
I have begun fletching out my first python project I created a few days ago. This is now more or less a game.

The game revolves around planting tree seeds which once grown, you can then cut down and sell, allowing you to buy more seeds.

Currently, the game contains:

-Three seed types, each with respective costs and wood types that are valued differently

-A shop allowing you to trade wood and buy seeds

-A number of music tracks

-A fully working saving system
