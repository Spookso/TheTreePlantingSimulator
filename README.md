# TheTreePlantingSimulator
I have begun fletching out my first python project I created a few days ago. This is now more or less a game.

The game revolves around planting tree seeds which once grown, you can then cut down and sell, allowing you to buy more seeds.
Currently, the game contains:

Three seed types

A shop allowing you to trade wood and buy seeds

A few music tracks

A fully working saving system
